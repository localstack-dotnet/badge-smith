# üîÄ Migration Strategy

*Last Updated: August 20, 2025*

## üéØ Migration Approach

BadgeSmith will use a **Big Bang migration strategy** - a complete cutover from the existing JavaScript implementation to the new .NET 8 Native AOT service. This approach is chosen for simplicity and to avoid the complexity of maintaining two parallel systems.

## üìã Migration Overview

### Current State

- **Existing Service**: JavaScript/Node.js Lambda function
- **Repository**: [localstack-nuget-badge-lambda](https://github.com/localstack-dotnet/localstack-nuget-badge-lambda)
- **Functionality**: LocalStack-specific package badges with limited test result support

### Target State

- **New Service**: .NET 8 Native AOT Lambda function
- **General Purpose**: Support for any NuGet/GitHub package
- **Enhanced Features**: Comprehensive test result ingestion with HMAC authentication
- **Performance**: Sub-100ms cold starts and improved response times

## üöÄ Migration Process

### Pre-Migration Phase

1. **Complete Development**: Finish all 6 implementation phases of BadgeSmith
2. **Testing Validation**: Comprehensive testing including performance benchmarks
3. **Documentation**: Complete API documentation and operational runbooks
4. **Monitoring Setup**: CloudWatch dashboards and alerting configured

### Migration Day

1. **Manual Cutover**: Direct replacement of Lambda function
2. **DNS/CloudFront Update**: Point traffic to new BadgeSmith service
3. **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring during cutover
4. **Rollback Ready**: JavaScript version available for immediate rollback if needed

### Post-Migration Phase

1. **Performance Monitoring**: Validate performance improvements
2. **User Communication**: Notify users of migration completion
3. **Legacy Cleanup**: Retire JavaScript implementation after successful validation
4. **Documentation Update**: Update all references to new service

## ‚ö° Benefits of Big Bang Approach

### Simplicity

- **Single Cutover**: No complex traffic splitting or parallel systems
- **Clear Timeline**: Definitive migration date and completion
- **Reduced Complexity**: No need to maintain API compatibility between systems
- **Manual Control**: Full control over migration timing and process

### Cost Efficiency

- **No Parallel Costs**: Avoid running two systems simultaneously
- **Quick Benefits**: Immediate access to performance improvements
- **Simplified Operations**: Single system to monitor and maintain

## üõ°Ô∏è Risk Mitigation

### Pre-Migration Validation

- **Load Testing**: Verify performance under production load
- **Compatibility Testing**: Ensure all existing badge URLs work correctly
- **Security Testing**: Validate HMAC authentication and security measures
- **Monitoring Testing**: Confirm all monitoring and alerting functions

### Migration Safety Measures

- **Rollback Plan**: JavaScript version ready for immediate restoration
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance and error monitoring during cutover
- **Staged Verification**: Validate critical endpoints immediately after cutover
- **Communication**: Clear escalation plan and team availability

### Post-Migration Monitoring

- **Performance Metrics**: Continuous monitoring of response times and error rates
- **User Feedback**: Monitor for user-reported issues
- **System Health**: Comprehensive health checks and alerting
- **Quick Response**: Rapid response team available for immediate issue resolution

## üìÖ Migration Timeline

### Week 1-10: Development Phase

- Complete all 6 BadgeSmith implementation phases
- Comprehensive testing and validation

### Week 11: Pre-Migration Preparation

- Final testing and performance validation
- Documentation completion
- Team preparation and coordination

### Week 12: Migration Execution

- **Day 1**: Manual cutover during low-traffic period
- **Day 2-7**: Intensive monitoring and validation
- **Week End**: Migration success validation and legacy cleanup

## üéØ Success Criteria

### Immediate Success (Day 1)

- ‚úÖ All existing badge URLs return correct responses
- ‚úÖ Response times meet or exceed performance targets
- ‚úÖ Error rates remain below 0.1%
- ‚úÖ Health checks confirm system stability

### Short-term Success (Week 1)

- ‚úÖ Performance improvements validated (sub-100ms cold starts)
- ‚úÖ No user-reported issues or service disruptions
- ‚úÖ Test result ingestion working correctly
- ‚úÖ HMAC authentication functioning properly

### Long-term Success (Month 1)

- ‚úÖ Cost reduction targets achieved (40%+ savings)
- ‚úÖ System stability and reliability confirmed
- ‚úÖ User satisfaction maintained or improved
- ‚úÖ Legacy JavaScript system safely retired
