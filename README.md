> **Badge service** for .NET packages and CI/CD test results with secure authentication and performance optimizations.

**BadgeSmith** is a general-purpose, high-performance badge service that provides [Shields.io](https://shields.io)-compatible endpoints for **NuGet packages**, **GitHub packages**, and **CI/CD test results**. Built with .NET 9 Native AOT for sub-100ms cold starts and designed for extensibility.

**Successor to [localstack-nuget-badge-lambda](https://github.com/localstack-dotnet/localstack-nuget-badge-lambda)** with 5-10x performance improvements and security features.

## üöÄ **Live Examples**

### **This Repository**

BadgeSmith badges itself using its own API:

[![Test Results (Linux)](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.localstackfor.net%2Fbadges%2Ftests%2Flinux%2Flocalstack-dotnet%2Fbadge-smith%2Fmaster)](https://api.localstackfor.net/redirect/test-results/linux/localstack-dotnet/badge-smith/master)

### **LocalStack.NET Client Examples**

üì¶ **LocalStack.NET Client v1.x**
[![NuGet v1.x](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.localstackfor.net%2Fbadges%2Fpackages%2Fnuget%2FLocalStack.Client%3Fversion%3D(1.0%2C2.0))](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LocalStack.Client/)

üì¶ **LocalStack.NET Client v2.x**
[![NuGet v2.x](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.localstackfor.net%2Fbadges%2Fpackages%2Fnuget%2FLocalStack.Client)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LocalStack.Client/)

## ‚ú® **Features**

### **üîí Secure Authentication**

- **HMAC-SHA256 authentication** with replay protection for test ingestion
- **AWS Secrets Manager** integration for credential management
- **Nonce-based replay prevention** using DynamoDB
- **Organization-level access control** with token type separation

### **‚ö° Performance Optimizations**

- **Native AOT compilation** for ~50-100ms cold starts (vs 500ms+ traditional)
- **DynamoDB with GSI** for efficient latest-result queries
- **Caching** with ETag support and configurable TTL
- **CloudFront-compatible** with proper cache headers

### **üéØ Flexible Design**

- **Multi-provider support**: NuGet.org, GitHub Packages (extensible)
- **Version filtering**: NuGet VersionRange support (`>=1.0.0`, `[6.0,8.0)`)
- **Platform-specific test badges**: Linux, Windows, macOS
- **Branch-aware**: Handles complex branch names with URL encoding

## üåê **API Endpoints**

### **Package Badges**

```bash
# NuGet packages
GET /badges/packages/nuget/{package}[?version={range}&prerelease={bool}]

# GitHub packages
GET /badges/packages/github/{org}/{package}[?version={pattern}&prerelease={bool}]
```

### **Test Result Badges**

```bash
# Display test badge
GET /badges/tests/{platform}/{owner}/{repo}/{branch}

# Test result ingestion (HMAC authenticated)
POST /tests/results/{platform}/{owner}/{repo}/{branch}

# Redirect to test results
GET /redirect/test-results/{platform}/{owner}/{repo}/{branch}
```

### **Examples**

```bash
# NuGet package badge
https://api.localstackfor.net/badges/packages/nuget/Newtonsoft.Json

# GitHub package with version filtering
https://api.localstackfor.net/badges/packages/github/localstack-dotnet/localstack.client?version=(1.0,2.0)

# Test results for this repository
https://api.localstackfor.net/badges/tests/linux/localstack-dotnet/badge-smith/master
```

## üöÄ **Quick Start**

### **Using the Public API**

```markdown
<!-- Add to your README.md -->
![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://api.localstackfor.net/badges/packages/nuget/YourPackage)
![Tests](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://api.localstackfor.net/badges/tests/linux/your-org/your-repo/main)
```

### **Self-Hosting**

```bash
# Clone and deploy
git clone https://github.com/localstack-dotnet/badge-smith.git
cd badge-smith/build
dotnet run --project BadgeSmith.CDK
```

### **Local Development**

```bash
# Start with .NET Aspire + LocalStack
dotnet run --project src/BadgeSmith.Host
```

## üîÑ **CI/CD Integration**

### **GitHub Actions**

Copy the reusable workflows to your repository:

```bash
cp -r .github/workflows/run-dotnet-tests/ your-repo/.github/workflows/
cp -r .github/workflows/update-test-badge/ your-repo/.github/workflows/
```

Then use in your workflow:

```yaml
- name: Update test badge
  uses: ./.github/workflows/update-test-badge
  with:
    platform: 'Linux'
    test_passed: '${{ steps.test-results.outputs.passed }}'
    test_failed: '${{ steps.test-results.outputs.failed }}'
    test_skipped: '${{ steps.test-results.outputs.skipped }}'
    hmac_secret: '${{ secrets.TESTDATASECRET }}'
    api_domain: 'api.localstackfor.net'
```

## üè¢ **LocalStack.NET Organization**

While designed as a **white-label solution**, BadgeSmith was created to serve the [LocalStack.NET organization](https://github.com/localstack-dotnet) badge requirements:

- **NuGet package badges** for LocalStack.NET client libraries, two track support (v1.x and v2.x)
- **GitHub package badges** for given repository, including pre-release versions
- **Multi-repository test badges** with platform-specific results
- **Secure test result ingestion** from CI/CD workflows

## üåü **Modern .NET Development Showcase**

BadgeSmith demonstrates current .NET development practices:

### **[.NET Aspire](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/) Integration**

- Local development orchestration with service discovery
- Observability with structured logging
- Shared infrastructure between dev/prod environments

### **[AWS Aspire Integrations](https://github.com/aws/integrations-on-dotnet-aspire-for-aws)**

- AWS Lambda and API Gateway emulation for local development
- CDK stack provisioning from Aspire host

### **[LocalStack Aspire Integration](https://github.com/localstack-dotnet/dotnet-aspire-for-localstack)**

- AWS service emulation for local development
- Identical schemas between local and production
- Local testing capabilities

### **Reusable CDK Patterns**

- Environment-agnostic infrastructure design
- Shared constructs between local and production for deployment consistency
- Type-safe infrastructure with .NET CDK
